# ICC Cricket Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of ICC Cricket datasets, focusing on batting statistics for T20, ODI, and Test formats. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into cricket performances across different formats. All code files, CSV datasets, and the Jupyter notebook used for this project are included in this repository.

## Contents

### Files:
1. **Code Files**
   - Python scripts used for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

2. **Datasets (CSV)**
   - `t20.csv`: Batting statistics for T20 matches.
   - `ODI data.csv`: Batting statistics for ODI matches.
   - `test_batting.csv`: Batting statistics for Test matches.

3. **Jupyter Notebook**
   - `icc-cricket-dataset-insights-and-predictions.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the step-by-step analysis, including data processing, visualization, and insights.

## Analysis Highlights
### Key Objectives:
- Analyze batting performance trends across different formats (T20, ODI, Test).
- Identify top-performing players and compare their consistency.
- Explore format-specific patterns (e.g., strike rates, averages, and centuries).

### Techniques and Tools Used:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, inconsistent data, and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to identify trends and distributions.
- **Visualization Libraries:**
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To document and showcase the analysis process interactively.
